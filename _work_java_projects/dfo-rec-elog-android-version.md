DFO Rec ELog for Android is an Android app used by recreational fishermen to collect and report accurate and timely fishing efforts. It was built in Java. The lastest version of the app required Android 5.0 or higher.

The app link on the Google Play was removed for some reason. It can be found [here](https://apkpure.com/dfo-rec-elog/com.mcwrightonline.dforecelog) on APKPure which is a website providing Android app APKs.

I actively participated in developing and testing the program. 

I implmented the views and layouts for activities. For storing data, CRUD functionality was developed with SQLite database. Google Map API was integrated to display the map with GPS location changes. I performed testing on the android emulator and multiple physical devices (phones and tablets). Bugs were found and fixed with code.
