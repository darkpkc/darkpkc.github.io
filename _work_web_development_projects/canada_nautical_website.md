pages are built with One.com website builder using HTML and CSS.

After meeting with company manager, I re-designed and solely developed the website for Canada Nautical. Three sections for publications were added on the Home page. The Buy Now button below each publication directs visitors to the corresponding online shop page. New Release section was also added to introduce Voyager Planning Station software. By clicking Learning More button, visitors are able to know more details about this software. Product page included unordered lists for five different catelogies. About Us page had meaningful copyright free images and company infos side by side. On Contact page, the Google Map screenshot was updated and large location icon was added. The issue that Google Map displayed wrong company location was also fixed properly. 

In the development of Home page, the page was slow to load sometimes. I did page speed test with Google PageSpeed Insights to find the root cause with large sizes of images. The high-resolution images were optimized with Photoshop and replaced to reduce page load time and speed up the website.
