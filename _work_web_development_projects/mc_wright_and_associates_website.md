The company website for M.C. Wright and Associates Ltd. is built on Joomla. Joomla is a free and open-source CMS for creating web content on websites.

I actively participated in developing and maintaining company website using Joomla. The templates were customized by modifying CSS file. The contents which include words, images, zip files, and pdf files were updated periodically. Some software related webpages were redesigned with different layouts to imrove ther user experiences. Two instructional videos for iPhone apps that we built were created and uploaded to Youtube. These two Youtube videos were embedded on company website by embedding iframe code into Source Code editor for article. Paypal payments was integrated by adding Buy Now buttons and descriptions.  

The company website attracted more visitors with updated layout, graphics and videos. The Canadian fishermen are able to download software builds and software manuals as well as make transactions via Paypal from the website.
