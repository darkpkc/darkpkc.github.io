The Canada Nautical online shop website is hosted and built on Wix. It had more than nine thousand products in over twenty different categories. It was the only online shopping site in British Columnbia offering world marine charts. The entire site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Wix Stores, which is a capable and customizable eCommerce platform offering various features and functionalities.

The online shop website can be found on [Canada Nautical Online Shop](https://www.canadanautical.shop/).

I solely developed the desktop and mobile sites for Canada Nautical from scratch. I was in charge of the entire project lifecycle, including strategy, design, development, test, and implementation.

Feasibility Analysis was conducted before the online shop was built. The Wix platform was selected against Shopify after taking techinical feasibility, economic feasibility and operational feasibility into consideration.

Navigation menu was designed and developed with Mega menus, which enabled pages to be split up by categories in a organized way. The animation of menu was implemented using CSS and JavaScript, and the icons were designed and edited with Photoshop. 
4 collections of products and 7 catagory boxes were displayed on Homepage to showcase the assortment and attract customers' attention.

Category pages listed various products with customerized filters. Well designed product pages turned vistors into customers with high quality images, informative descriptions, product variants, and product prices.

I took care of all aspects of product data in eCommerce management, including data entry, optimization, and maintenace of content, etc. An efficient method was created to batch update product infos and images using Dropbox and CSV file. With this method, hundreds of products with detailed infos and photos were uploaded at the same time on Wix Store platform. It was amazing and remarkable that total time for uploading and processing was usually less than 3 minutes.

Shopping cart and checkout page were customized to provide streamlined, user-friendly, and simple checkout process. Request for demo feature was implemented wtih Wix Forms. Search box and search result page were added to help visitors to find wanted products by matching keywords. FAQs provided quick answers for visitors with Wix FAQ app.

After meeting with company manager, marketing campaigns were planned and performed. It included on-site merchandising, email marketing, and seasonal/holiday promotional offers, etc.

SEO techniques, including optimizing product meta tags, product image alt attributes and etc, were implemented to expand customer base and improve brand awareness. Google Analytics was used to track online traffic and conversions and understand user behavior.

The online shop was really successful. In 2021, the sales was increased 30% compared with the previous year. It reached around 500 monthly unique vistors. In contrast, the rule of thumb for average small company in nautical supplies industry was only 100 visitors per month.
