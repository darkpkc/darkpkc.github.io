Wreck was an escape game with sufficient functions which have 7 forms by VB.NET with other 2 team members in a course project.

{% include gallery id="gallery-game-scenes" %}

I mainly developed the wreck game, including creating UI, gathering resource, and writing codes to implement features, etc.

{% include gallery id="gallery-game-plays" %}

Two different game modes were developed - easy mode and diffcult mode. In easy mode, limited game scenes and unlimited gaming time were provided. In diffcult mode, more game scenes, tensional backgroud music, and limited gaming time with countdown timer were developed to attract players' attention.

Some features were developed to allow players to access various in-game settings, such as font control, music control and volume control. Game hint screen and help screen were available if the player was stuck on how to proceed in the game.

Wreck was an interesting escape game as well as a successful project. It carried out both low level prototyping and high level prototyping. The end users were interacted and interface evaluation was conducted throughout the entire project. Every team member were satisfied with the project result.
